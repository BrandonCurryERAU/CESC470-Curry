For this assignment I used EDA Playground to create a design & testbench of my previous FSM of the streetlight system. The streetlightFSM module encompases four states that are ran by a clock and can be reset as well. Case statements are used to change between states depending on input. The testbench is also created to test the working operation of the FSM as shown on the left-side of the picture.
