**Explanation**

This single-cycle datapath utilizes the 5-stage MIPS pipeline with four pipeline registers (IF/ID, ID/EX, EX/MEM, MEM/WB). During the IF (Information Fetching) stage, the Program Counter (PC) provides the instruction address to instruction memory. The instruction as well the PC+4 (the address of the next instruction) is sent to the IF/ID pipeline register. In the ID (Information Decoding) stage, the register file would read source operands and control signals from the control unit. This information is sent to the ID/EX pipeline register. During the Execute (EX) stage, the ALU performs the arithmetic, and the result as well the control signals are sent to the EX/MEM pipeline register for any data memory to be accessed in the MEM stage. During the WriteBack (WB) stage, final results are written to the register file through the MEM/WB pipeline. An exmaple of a hazard which can occur is a data hazard in the EX stage, where an instruction could be waiting for the result of another instruction that is still going through the pipeline. A mitigation strategy that is used is by forwarding. Multiplexors can take ALU results from EX/MEM or MEM/WB back back to the input of the ALU, which can prevent stalls from happening due to waiting for data.
